Welcome to my personal website! My name is Thilanka Liyanaarachchi, and I am a Senior Tech Lead based in Sri Lanka. With over 8 years of experience in the industry, I have honed my skills in `Java`, Scala, and backend development. Additionally, I have experience in frontend development with SvelteJS and Angular, and I am passionate about exploring new technologies to enhance my skill set.

I also have expertise in DevOps, with experience working with AWS, GitLab, Kubernetes, and Terraform. Through my work, I have developed a strong understanding of the software development lifecycle and enjoy the challenges of ensuring seamless integration between development and operations.

This website serves as a portfolio of my work and experiences, and I am excited to share my knowledge and insights with others in the community. Whether you are a fellow developer, a potential collaborator, or just interested in learning more about my work, I hope you find my website informative and engaging. Thank you for visiting!
